Why EdenServer?
-----------------------------------------------------------
EdenServer continues where AMD left off. It recursively bundles files, resolves dependencies, adds assets such as html and css and runs pipeline tasks such as minification and compilation (e.g.less).

And it does all of that highly efficient while you develop as well as in production.

Starting the server
-----------------------------------------------------------
Fork or download EdenServer from Github. It is written in node.js, so if you haven't installed node yet, you can download it at nodejs.org To start it, run:

cd server
node start.js

Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------
This is just a quick introduction into some of the features of EdenServer.

A proper tutorial and documentation will follow soon. For the time being please have a look at the example applications in the /apps directory.
